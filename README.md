CSS: Media Queries Exercise

# CSS: Media Queries Exercise

Update to 2023 and make it responsive and adaptative to different screen sizes:

- Start with [this webpage](https://www.teaching-materials.org/_deprecated/csstools/exercises/exercise_media_before), which already has HTML and CSS for a header, navigation, content, sidebar, and footer. This is what it looks like:

- Add a CSS media query and appropriate styles so that the webpage looks like the screenshot below when printed. Specifically:

  - The header, navigation, and footer should be hidden.
  - The sidebar should display under the main content.

- Add a CSS media query and appropriate styles so that the webpage looks like the screenshots below when resized to smaller widths. Specifically:

  - The sidebar should be hidden.
  - The body should have no padding.
  - The images shouldn't exceed the width of the window.
  - The navigation items should each be on their own line.
  - The header should be fixed, so that it stays at the top after scrolling.
